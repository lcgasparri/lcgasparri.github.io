				Predicativists hold that proper names are count nouns with a predicative meaning, and treat bare singular names as predicative DPs headed by an unpronounced definite.
				However, bare singular names exhibit differences in grammatical behavior from ordinary definite singulars.
				One difference, it has been argued, is that while ordinary definite singulars can be interpreted generically, bare singular names cannot.
				This is not right: bare singular names can have generic uses.
				I present the evidence and offer an argument that generics with bare singular names are good news for predicativists.

				Standard metasemantic frameworks render word meanings resistant to the control of ordinary speakers, and hinder our ability to exercise sovereignty over the denotations of words.
				The literature suggests three main responses to the problem: views on which ordinary denotational interventions cannot cause changes to semantic reality,
				views on which we should drop the metasemantic premises that generate the difficulty, and views on which denotational interventions boil down to operations on a non-recalcitrant region of the semantic spectrum.
				I review these responses and argue that they face difficulties.
				Then, I draw on linguistic work on variation to make an alternative proposal.
				I suggest that part of the problem hinges on a tendency to think about standing meanings under heavily idealized assumptions of intra-linguistic homogeneity.
				To amend this, we should consider endorsing a localist ontology for semantic properties that allows individual vocabulary items to bear variable standing meanings at different communities of speakers of a public language.
				The result, I argue, is a middle-ground framework which accepts the difficulties of wide-scope meaning change while granting speakers semantic self-determination, and strikes an attractive balance between a few central desiderata.

				I develop an account of natural conventions that distinguishes two basic dimensions of conventional naturalness: a probabilistic dimension and an inherent one.
				A convention is probabilistically natural if it is likely to emerge in a population of agents, and inherently natural if its content is a regularity that scores high on relevant measures for naturalness.
				I motivate the proposal on conceptual grounds and then showcase its descriptive benefits by discussing two case studies in language:
				the tendency towards word-length optimality and the prevalence of shape opacity in spoken language vocabularies.

				I argue that ontologies of words should engage with the emergence of lexical communication in the deep history of our line.
				It may seem that the evolutionary origins of words are orthogonal to the analytical project of establishing the defining features of wordhood, and that an adequate ontology of words requires nothing more than an observation of the properties of modern languages.
				I suggest instead that models of the initial stages of language evolution can offer valuable insights into the matter.
				There is consensus that lexical communication was an early achievement in the phylogeny of our language capacities, and that words became available to our ancestors before the maturation of other components of the grammar.
				At the beginning of their evolutionary trajectory, words are thus likely to have been significantly different from the vocabulary items of contemporary languages.
				Careful appreciation of such differences could be instrumental to a complete theory of the hallmarks of wordhood.

				Arbitrariness is a distinctive feature of human language, and a growing body of comparative work is investigating its presence in animal communication. But what is arbitrariness, exactly?
				We propose to distinguish four notions of semiotic arbitrariness:
				a notion of opaque association between sign forms and semiotic functions, one of sign-function mapping optionality, one of acquisition-dependent sign-function coupling, and one of lack of motivatedness.
				We characterize these notions, illustrate the benefits of keeping them apart, and describe two reactions to our proposal:
				abandoning arbitrariness-talk in favor of the newly introduced conceptual vocabulary, or feeding the distinctions back into the parent concept.

			<p class="font-monospace small">
				A critical feature of language is that the form of words need not bear any perceptual similarity to their function - these relationships can be &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo;.
				The capacity to process these arbitrary form-function associations facilitates the enormous expressive power of language.
				However, the evolutionary roots of our capacity for arbitrariness, i.e. the extent to which related abilities may be shared with animals, is largely unexamined.
				We argue this is due to the challenges of applying such an intrinsically linguistic concept to animal communication, and address this by proposing a novel conceptual framework highlighting a key underpinning of linguistic arbitrariness, which is nevertheless applicable to non-human species.
				Specifically, we focus on the capacity to associate alternative functions with a signal, or alternative signals with a function, a feature we refer to as optionality.
				We apply this framework to a broad survey of findings from animal communication studies and identify five key dimensions of communicative optionality: signal production, signal adjustment, signal usage, signal combinatoriality and signal perception.
				We find that optionality is widespread in non-human animals across each of these dimensions, although only humans demonstrate it in all five.
				Finally, we discuss the relevance of optionality to behavioural and cognitive domains outside of communication.
				This investigation provides a powerful new conceptual framework for the cross-species investigation of the origins of arbitrariness, and promises to generate original insights into animal communication and language evolution more generally.

				Ordinary disposition ascriptions (DAs) appear to form a semantically heterogeneous class of clauses some of which can be straightforwardly analyzed as possibility claims, and some of which resist a simple quantificational treatment.
				For example, while “The block is breakable” is true if the block breaks at a relevant possible world, for “The block is fragile” to be true it doesn’t suffice that the block breaks at one of the worlds that matter to the evaluation of the ascription, since the block could break accidentally and yet be sturdy.
				The contrast has been taken to indicate that sentences like “The block is fragile” don’t introduce mere existential quantification over sets of worlds, and should be represented as claims about sufficient ratios or proportions of worlds.
				However, recent work has suggested that by pairing the recalcitrant DAs with modified manifestation phrases, we can generalize the standard analysis of existential DAs to the problematic examples, and state a uniform characterization of DAs as claims of possibility.
				The paper discusses some counterexamples to the view that allegedly non-existential DAs are covert claims of fine-grained possibility, and sketches a hybrid account combining proportional quantification with fine-grained manifestations.

				Lexical innovations (e.g., zero-derivations coined on the fly by a speaker) seem to bear semantic content.
				Yet, such expressions cannot bear semantic content as a function of the conventions of meaning in force in the language, since they are not part of its lexicon.
				This is in tension with the commonplace view that the semantic content of lexical expressions is constituted by semantic conventions.
				The conventionalist has two immediate ways out of the tension.
				The first is to preserve the conventionalist assumption and deny that lexical innovations bear semantic content.
				The second is to dynamize the conventionalist assumption, that is, argue that presentations of unattested expressions trigger an augmentation of the standing semantic resources of the language and instantiate semantic content as a result of this underlying update.
				Building on a comparison with the production of novel onomatopoeic words, iconic pseudowords and pro-speech gestures,
				the paper argues that the issue is best addressed by suspending the conventionalist assumption, and describes the immediate metasemantic implications of the claim.

				It is common belief that semantic properties supervene on non-semantic properties: no two possible worlds can be non-semantic duplicates and fail to be semantic duplicates.
				The view enjoys somewhat of an orthodoxy status in contemporary philosophy of language and metaphysics, and is often assumed without argument.
				Yet, work by Stephen Kearns and Ofra Magidor has claimed that it is vulnerable to a variant of the classical arguments against the supervenience of the phenomenal on the physical.
				This paper does three things: it clarifies what semantic supervenience is about, it responds to the objections that have been leveled against it, and provides a new battery of arguments in its favor.
				I argue that the thesis of semantic supervenience is safe from classical anti-supervenience arguments, and show that its rejection generates unwelcome consequences.
				I conclude that there are substantial reasons to embrace the received wisdom: semantic properties supervene.

				According to the perceptual view of language comprehension, listeners typically recover high-level linguistic properties such as utterance meaning without inferential work.
				The perceptual view is subject to the Objection from Context: since utterance meaning is massively context-sensitive, and context-sensitivity requires cognitive inference, the perceptual view is false.
				In recent work, Berit Brogaard provides a challenging reply to this objection. She argues that in language comprehension context-sensitivity is typically exercised not through inferences, but rather through top-down perceptual modulations or perceptual learning.
				This paper provides a complete formulation of the Objection from Context and evaluates Brogaard&rsquo;s reply to it. Drawing on conceptual considerations and empirical examples,
				we argue that the exercise of context-sensitivity in language comprehension does, in fact, typically involve inference.

				the expressions occurring between quotation marks are mentioned and do not take their ordinary referents. The quoted NP &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; refers, if anything, to the name &lsquo;Bill&rsquo;, not to the individual Bill. At the same time, the pronoun &ldquo;he&rdquo;,

				Second, I will explore some ways Borg might respond to my argument and maintain that none of them offers a conclusive reply to my case.
				Third, I shall suggest that in order for Borg&rsquo;s minimalism to accommodate the problem discussed in this paper, it should allow for semantically incomplete content and be converted into a claim about linguistic competence.
